# Advanced Portfolio Optimization Techniques

## Project Overview

This project explores and implements various sophisticated techniques for portfolio optimization, leveraging quantitative finance models and computational methods. The goal is to develop a comprehensive framework for optimizing asset allocation while balancing risk and return.

## Key Techniques Explored

1. **Monte-Carlo Simulation**: 
   - Implemented a robust simulation engine performing 10,000 iterations
   - Used to assess risk, uncertainty, and potential portfolio outcomes

2. **Markowitz Efficient Frontier Model**: 
   - Applied modern portfolio theory to optimize asset allocation
   - Calculated efficient frontiers to illustrate risk-return trade-offs

3. **Black-Litterman Model**: 
   - Integrated market equilibrium with investor views
   - Enhanced portfolio construction by incorporating subjective outlooks

4. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: 
   - Utilized to understand the relationship between systematic risk and expected return
   - Applied in conjunction with other models for comprehensive analysis
